## Sending and receiving texts in Slack

With FounderPhone, every customer phone number is associated with a separate Slack channel. 

***How to reply to a text from a customer:***

When a customer first texts you, a new Slack channel will be created for that customer. To  reply to a text from a customer, type `"@FounderPhone <message to send>"` in the channel associated with that customer.

*Note that messages entered in the channel will not automatically be sent to the customer associated with the channel.* This means that you and your team can discuss customer messages directly in the channel associated with the customer, and then respond to the customer in the same channel.

You can also rename the channel to anything you want (e.g., the customer's name). The FounderPhone app will remember the phone number associated with the channel.

***How to initiate a text with a customer who hasn't texted you before:***
1. Create new channel in Slack where you want to send and receive texts from a customer
2. Add FounderPhone to the channel by typing "@FounderPhone", hitting "enter", and clicking "Invite to Channel"
3. Use the slash command `"/founderphonetext <number to text> <message to send>"` to send a text to the customer. The `<number to text>` should be in the following format: +5107562522
4. For all subsequent messages to the customer, simply type `"@FounderPhone <message to send>"` (the same command as if you are replying to a customer)

## Call forwarding

FounderPhone can forward calls to any valid phone number.

1. Log in to [FounderPhone](https://founderphone.com) and follow the instructions below
2. Enter the phone number where you want your FounderPhone calls to be forwarded to in the "Forward voice calls box". The phone number should be in the following format: +5107562522
